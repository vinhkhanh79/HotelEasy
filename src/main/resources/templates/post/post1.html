                <p><strong>District 2:</strong> Compared to the bustling downtown, District 2 offers a more relaxed experience with open riverside space. Although not purely "authentic" Vietnam, neither is downtown. <br>
                Staying in District 2 has become more appealing, as it has developed into an international culinary hub rivaling District 1.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Staying in Cholon and Other Areas:</strong><br>
                Cholon – Saigon’s Chinatown – is even more lively than the downtown. It retains a nostalgic charm that's fading elsewhere in the city. Traveling from Cholon to downtown Saigon takes about 15-20 minutes depending on traffic. <br>
                Cholon offers a unique vibe that many see as the "real Saigon."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Airbnb in Saigon:</strong><br>
                Airbnb has thrived in Saigon. Many apartments in new towers across the city are listed on Airbnb. Before COVID, retro-styled old apartments were also popular on Airbnb, but there are fewer now. <br>
                Apartments in District 4 (near District 1), Binh Thanh, and District 2 are great choices for Airbnb stays.<br>
                Be careful when booking, as some Airbnb services in the city are unreliable. Airbnb hasn’t done enough to ensure user safety.</p>
